\subsection*{Extension 1}
We show that the set can be the graph of a function! Let \(Z\) be a borel set of positive measure and define
\[
    T_Z = \{ x : \lambda(Z_x) > 0 \}.
\]
Then \(T_Z\) is a measurable set by Fubini's Theorem. We can pick a compact subset \( T'_Z \). A compact set of positive measure has at least \(\mathfrak{c}\) elements, and there are as many borel sets. Then, enumerate borel sets of \( \mathbb{R}^2 \).

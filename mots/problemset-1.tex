\begin{lemma}\label{CuttingOutMeasure}
    Let \(A\), \(A_1\), \ldots, \(A_k\) be measurable sets such that
    \[
        \forall k.\, \mu(A_i \cap A) \geq (1 - \delta_i)\mu(A).
    \]
    Then
    \[
        \mu(A \cap A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \ldots \cap A_k) \geq \left(1 - \sum \delta_i \right) \mu(A).
    \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Union bound on the sets
    \[
        A \cap A_i^c.
    \]
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Remark.} There is an infinitary version.

\subsection*{Extension 1}
We show that the set can be the graph of a function! Let \(Z\) be a borel set of positive measure and define
\[
    T_Z = \{ x : \lambda(Z_x) > 0 \}.
\]
Then \(T_Z\) is a measurable set by Fubini's Theorem. We can pick a compact subset \( T'_Z \). A compact set of positive measure has at least \(\mathfrak{c}\) elements, and there are as many borel sets. Then, enumerate borel sets of \( \mathbb{R}^2 \).

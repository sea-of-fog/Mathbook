\section{The Countability Axioms}

\subsection{Definitions}

\begin{defn}[Basis at a point]
\label{BasisAtPoint}
\hypertarget{BasisAtPoint}
Let \( x \in X \). A collection \( \mathcal{B} \) of neighbourhoods of \( x \) is a \textbf{basis at \( x \)} iff every open neighbourhood \( U \ni x \) contains a member of \( \mathcal{B} \), i.e. there is a \( B \in \mathcal{B} \) s. that \( x \in B \subseteq U \).
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[First countability]
\label{FirstCountable}
\hypertarget{FirstCountable}
A space \( X \) is said to be \textbf{first-countable} if it has a countable basis \( \mathcal{B}_x \) at each of its points \( x \in X \).
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Second countability]
\label{SecondCountable}
\hypertarget{SecondCountable}
A space \( X \) is said to be \textbf{second-countable} if it has a countable basis.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Dense subset]
\label{DenseSubset}
\hypertarget{DenseSubset}
A subset \( D \subseteq X \) is said to be \textbf{dense} if
\[ 
    \Cl D = X. 
\]
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Lindel\"of property]
\label{Lindelof}
\hypertarget{Lindelof}
A space \( X \) is called \textbf{Lindel\"of} if every open cover of \( X \) admits a countable subcover.
\end{defn}
.
\subsection{Lemmas}

\begin{lemma}[Picking a decreasing basis at point]
\label{PointBasisDecreasing}
\hypertarget{PointBasisDecreasing}
Let \( \mathcal{B} = \left\{ B_1, B_2, \ldots \right\} \) be a basis for the topology of \( X \) at a point \( x \in X \). Then the sequence
\[ 
    B_1, B_1 \cap B_2, B_1 \cap B_2 \cap B_3, \ldots 
\]
is a decreasing inscribed basis at \( X \).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    All of these sets contain \( x \). Since any neighbourhood of \( U \ni x \) contains some \( B_k \), it will also contain the set \( B_1 \cap B_2 \cap \ldots \cap B_k \).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Theorems}

\begin{thm}[Continuity in first-countable spaces]
\label{FirstCountableContinuousFunctions}
\hypertarget{FirstCountableContinuousFunctions}
If \( f: X \to Y \) is continuous, then for all sequences \( x_n \to x \) we have \( f(x_n) \to f(x) \). If additionally \( X \) is first-countable, then then converse is also true. 
\end{thm}

\begin{proof} 
    For the forward implication, pick any \( U \in N_{f(x)} \). Then \( V := f^{-1}[U] \) is open, so, for all but finitely many indices \( n \), \( x_n \in V \). Then for the same indices \( f(x_n) \in U \).

    For the backward, let \( B_n \) be a countable basis of X at \( x \) and suppose without loss of generality that \( B_n \) is decreasing. Pick again an open neighbourhood \( U \in N_{f(x)} \). If \( f^{-1}[U] \) is not open, then choose a sequence \( x_n \in B_n \setminus f^{-1}[U] \). This means that \( f(x_n) \not\in U \) for all \( n \), but \( f(x_n) \to f(x) \), a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[Closures in first-countable spaces]
\label{FirstCountableClosures}
\hypertarget{FirstCountableClosures}
If \( x_n \in A \) and \( x_n \to x \), we can conclude that \( x \in \Cl A \). The converse holds in a first-countable space.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    For the forward implication, every neighbourhood \( U \ni x \) contains a point of \( A \), and even infinitely many of them, so \( x \in \Cl A \).

    For the backward implication, suppose \( x \in \Cl A \) and \( \mathcal{B} = \left\{ B_1, B_2, \ldots \right\} \) is a countable basis at \( x \), without loss of generality decreasing. Then every set \( B_n \) contains a point of \( A \), so we can for a sequence \( x_n \in A \cap B_n \). Since \( B_i \searrow \), for any neighbourhood \( U \ni x \), \( B_N \subseteq U \) for some \( N \), and so \( U \) contains all \( x_n \) for \( n \geqslant N \). Therefore \( x_n \to x \) is a sequence of elements of \( A \) convergent to \( x \).
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[First- and second-countability are hereditary]
\label{FirstSecondCountabilityHereditary}
\hypertarget{FirstSecondCountabilityHereditary}
Let \( X \) be second- or first-countable space. Then, if \( Y \) is subspace of \( X \), \( Y \) is also, respectively, second- or first-countable.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    Let \( B_k \) be a basis for \( X \). Then \( B_k \cap Y \) is a basis for \( Y \). Indeed, any open set \( U \subseteq Y \) is of the form \( V \cap Y \) for some open \( V \subseteq X \). Then \( V \supseteq B_k \) for some \( k \), to \( U = V \cap Y \supseteq B_k \cap Y \). An analogous argument holds for a basis at \( y \in Y \).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Problems}

\begin{problem}[P30.18 from \cite{Mun14}]
\label{MunkresP30.18}
\hypertarget{MunkresP30.18}
    Let \( G \) be a first-countable topological group. Show that if \( G \) is either separable or Lindel\"of, then \( G \) is also second-countable.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}[Solution (for separable spaces)]
    Let \( D = \left\{ d_1, d_2, \ldots \right\} \) be the countable dense subset and \( \mathcal{B} = \left\{ B_1, B_2 \ldots \right\} \) a basis at \( e \). We will use the dense subset to \emph{spread} the local basis over the group. Concretely, we claim that the countable basis can be given by
    \[ 
       d_m B_n,
   \]
   i.e. left translations of the basis at \( e \). Pick any open set \( U \subseteq G \) and its element \( g \in U \subseteq G \). The left-transalted set \( g^{-1}U \) contains \( e = g^{-1}g \), so we can pick a neighbourhood \( B_n \subseteq g^{-1}U \) or, equivalently, \( g \in gB_n \subseteq U \).
   At this point it might be true that for some \( d_m \) we will have \( g \in d_mB_n \subseteq U \). However, by continuity of the group operations we can shrink \( B_n \) to \( B_k \) such that \( B_k \cdot B_k \subseteq B_m \). Then, pick a \( d_m \in gB_k \). We can now compute that
\begin{align*}
    d_m &\in gB_k  \\
    g^{-1}d_m &\in B_k \\
    e \in g^{-1}d_mB_k &\subseteq B_kB_k \subseteq B_m \\
    g \in d_mB_k &\subseteq gB_m \subseteq U, \\
\end{align*}
which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Solution (for Lindel\"of spaces)]
    Let \( \mathcal{B} = \left\{ B_1, B_2, \ldots \right\} \) be a countable basis at \( e \). For a given \( B_k \), consider the cover
    \[ 
       \mathcal{A}_k = \left\{ gB_k : g \in G \right\}.
   \]
   By the Lindel\"of property, we can pick a countable subset \( G_k \subseteq G \) such that the family \( \left\{ gB_k : g \in G_k \right\} \)is a subcover of \( \mathcal{A_k} \). Now do this for all \( k \in \mathbb{N} \) and, for convenince, take
   \[ 
       %TODO: upward sum
       G_0 := \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty G_k. 
  \]
  We claim that sets of the form
  \[ 
     g_0B_k 
 \]
 for \( g_0 \in G_0 \) and \( B_k \in \mathcal{B} \) form a countable basis. Pick any open set and its element \( g \in U \subseteq G \). We repeat the solution of the previous subproblem. To be explicit, we can find an \( m \) such that \( gB_m \subseteq U \). Now pick a \( B_k \) with the property that \( B_k \cdot B_k \subseteq B_m \). Since the family \( \left\{ gB_k : g \in G_0 \right\} \), we can find some \( g_0 \) s. that \( g \in g_0B_k \subseteq gB_m \subseteq U \).
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Remark.} The set \( G_0 \) is actually a dense set for the topology of \( G \).

\paragraph{Remark.} This is one of the situations in which the relationships between countability axioms can be reversed, that is a subset of weaker axioms implies second-countability.

\subsection{Chapter review questions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the significance of first-countability for closures?

    \textbf{Answer:} In a first-countable space closures are determined by sequences. That is, \( x \in \Cl A \)iff there is a sequence \( x_n \in A \) s. that \( x_n \to x \). In general only the backward implication holds. See \hyperlink{FirstCountableClosures}{here} for a proof.

    \item What is the significance of first-countability for continuous function?

    \textbf{Answer:} If \( X \) is first-countable, then a function \( f: X \to Y \) is continuous iff for all sequences \( x_n \to x \) we have \( f(x_n) \to f(x) \). In general, only the forward implication holds. Prove \hyperlink{FirstCountableContinuousFunctions}{this}.
    
    \item What examples does Munkres give for a first-countable space that is not second-countable?

        \textbf{Answer:} \( \mathbb{R}^\omega \) is first-countable as it is a metric space, but is not second-countable, because it has a discrete set \( \{ 0,\,1 \}^\omega \) of size \( \mathfrak{c} \).
    \item How large can a discrete subspace of a second-countable space be?
    
    \textbf{Answer:} At most countable. A discrete subspace can be injected into the basis, so it has a smaller size.
    \item What are the relations between countability propeties?

    \textbf{Answer:} Second-countability implies all other properties. See \hyperlink{MetrisableSpaceCountabilityProperties}{here} for a proof. Not even a conjuction of the three others implies second-countability, as shown by the Sorgenfrey line \( \mathbb{S} \).
    \item What is the significance of the Sorgenfrey line \( \mathbb{S} \) for countability axioms? Which countability properties does it have?
    \item What is the significance of the Sorgenfrey plane \( \mathbb{S}^2 \) for countability axioms? Which countability properties does it have?

        \textbf{Answer:}  The Sorgenfrey plane is first-countable, separable, but neither second-countable nor Lindel\"of. Thus it is a product of Lindel\"of spaces which is not Lindel\"of, establishing that Lindel\"ofness is not productive. The proof uses the fact that the antidiagonal is a closed discrete subspace.

    \item What is the significance of the ordered square \( I_o^2 \) for countability axioms? Which countability properties does it have?
    \item How can you make it easier to check the Lindel\"of property?
    \item Under what conditions do the relations between countability axioms reverse, i.e. what can you use to conclude that a space is second-countable from the other axioms?
    
        \textbf{Answer:} (1) metrisable spaces are all first-countable, but either the Lindel\"of property or separability imply second-countability (\hyperlink{MetrisableSpaceCountabilityProperties}{proof}) (2) a first-countable topological group satisfying either the Lindel\"of property or separability is second-countable (\hyperlink{MunkresP30.18}{proof}).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Questions about property preservation}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How does first-countability behave under taking subspaces?

    \textbf{Answer: } First-countability is preserved under taking subspaces. See \hyperlink{FirstSecondCountabilityHereditary}{here}.
    \item How does first-countability behave under products?
    \item How does first-countability behave under coproducts?

    \textbf{Answer: } Since first-countability only concerns what happens around a point, it is preserved under arbitrary coproducts.
    \item How does first-countability behave under surjections?
    \item How does first-countability behave under quotients?
    \item How does second-countability behave under taking subspaces?
    \textbf{Answer: } Second-countability is preserved under taking subspaces. See \hyperlink{FirstSecondCountabilityHereditary}{here}.
    \item How does second-countability behave under products?
    \item How does second-countability behave under coproducts?
    \item How does second-countability behave under surjections?
    \item How does second-countability behave under quotients?
    \item How does being Lindel\"of behave under taking subspaces?
    \item How does being Lindel\"of behave under products?
    \item How does being Lindel\"of behave under coproducts?
    \item How does being Lindel\"of behave under surjections?
    \item How does being Lindel\"of behave under quotients?

    \textbf{Answer:} Since the Lindel\"of property is surjective, it is also preserved under quotients.
    \item How does (topological) separability behave under taking subspaces?
    
    \textbf{Answer:} Separability is not preserved under taking subspaces, not even closed ones. This is shown by the antidiagonal subspace \( \Delta^- \) of the Sorgenfrey line.
    \item How does separability behave under products?
    \item How does separability behave under coproducts?
    \item How does separability behave under surjections?
    \item How does separability behave under quotients?
    
    \textbf{Answer:} Since separability is surjective, it is preserved under quotients.

\section{The Countability Axioms}

\subsection{Definitions}

\begin{defn}[Basis at a point]
\label{BasisAtPoint}
\hypertarget{BasisAtPoint}
Let \( x \in X \). A collection \( \mathcal{B} \) of neighbourhoods of \( x \) is a \textbf{basis at \( x \)} iff every open neighbourhood \( U \ni x \) contains a member of \( \mathcal{B} \), i.e. there is a \( B \in \mathcal{B} \) s. that \( x \in B \subseteq U \).
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[First countability]
\label{FirstCountable}
\hypertarget{FirstCountable}
A space \( X \) is said to be \textbf{first-countable} if it has a countable basis \( \mathcal{B}_x \) at each of its points \( x \in X \).
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Second countability]
\label{SecondCountable}
\hypertarget{SecondCountable}
A space \( X \) is said to be \textbf{second-countable} if it has a countable basis.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Dense subset]
\label{DenseSubset}
\hypertarget{DenseSubset}
A subset \( D \subseteq X \) is said to be \textbf{dense} if
\[ 
    \Cl D = X. 
\]
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Lindel\"of]
\label{Lindelof}
\hypertarget{Lindelof}
A space \( X \) is called \textbf{Lindel\"of} if every open cover of \( X \) admits a countable subcover.
\end{defn}

\subsection{Chapter review questions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the significance of first-countability for closures?
    \item What is the significance of first-countability for continuous function?
    \item What examples does Munkres give for a first-countable space that is not second-countable?
    \item How large can a discrete subspace of a second-countable space be?
    \item What are the relations between countability propeties?
    \item What is the significance of the Sorgenfrey line \( \mathbb{S} \) for countability axioms? Which countability properties does it have?
    \item What is the significance of the Sorgenfrey plane \( \mathbb{S}^2 \) for countability axioms? Which countability properties does it have?
    \item What is the significance of the ordered square \( I_o^2l \)?
    \item What are the relations between countability properties?
    \item How can you make it easier to check the Lindel\"of property?
